Git mirror of Carnix
====================

This is a git mirror of the source code for `carnix`, a tool used to
generate Nix-expressions for Rust crates.

Carnix was originally released by [Pijul][], however the [old source
repository][] was never updated after version `0.5` and is now offline
entirely.

There are still releases happening on [crates.io][] and I am simply
mirroring these into this git repository to make the source code
easily accessible, but for now there won't be any changes happening
here directly.
